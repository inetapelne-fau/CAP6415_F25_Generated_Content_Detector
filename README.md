# Face Photo Generator Content Detector: Real vs AI-Generated Faces
## 📚 Description
This project aims to develop a content detection system that can differentiate between real human faces and AI-generated faces. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies in generating realistic images, it is crucial to create tools that can identify the authenticity of facial images. This project leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning models to provide an effective solution for detecting AI-generated faces.

## 📂 Dataset
The project leverages a diverse dataset that includes both real and AI-generated face images sourced from multiple Kaggle datasets. By carefully mixing and matching four distinct sources, the final dataset comprises 5,000 real images and 5,000 AI-generated images, organized into training, testing, and validation sets. This enhanced diversity has led to improved model performance, demonstrating the positive impact of having a varied dataset on classification accuracy.
