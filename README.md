# Face Photo Generator Content Detector: Real vs AI-Generated Faces
This project focuses on developing a computer vision system that can accurately differentiate between real face photos and AI-generated faces. Using deep learning techniques, the system aims to classify facial images with high accuracy and robustness. The work involves dataset collection, image preprocessing, model training, and evaluating performance under various distortions, contributing to the understanding and application of face recognition and fake image detection in computer vision.
