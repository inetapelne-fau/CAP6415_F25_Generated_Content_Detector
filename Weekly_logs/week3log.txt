Implementation of Early Stopping in the current PyTorch CNN model:
- Introduced early stopping based on validation loss to mitigate overfitting caused by high variance.
- This technique allows the model to terminate training when performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing excessive fitting to the training data.
- The implementation reduced training time from 1 hour and 15 minutes to under 30 minutes. Furthermore, prior to optimizing with a more powerful GPU, training duration exceeded 5 hours.

Impact on Model Performance:
- The implementation of early stopping has significantly improved the model's performance on unseen data from the outside dataset.
- The model still maintains an impressive 97% overall performance accuracy while achieving 89% accuracy on the outside dataset.
- This demonstrates a successful balance between model generalization and retention of high accuracy across different datasets.

Created Confusion Matrix:
- Correct Classifications: 965 instances of the "AI" class and 969 instances of the "real" class were accurately identified.
- Misclassifications: 36 "real" images were misclassified as "AI"; 32 "AI" images were misclassified as "real."
- Overall Performance: Indicates some confusion between the two categories despite strong accuracy.

Improvement Strategies: 
- Model Architecture: Utilize ResNet to leverage its depth and skip connections for improved feature extraction and performance.
- Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the final layer of the model to adapt specifically to the dataset, enhancing classification accuracy.
- Regularization: Incorporate a dropout layer to minimize overfitting, thus improving model generalization.
- Model Simplification: Consider creating a simpler model with fewer layers to reduce complexity and computational load, which can facilitate faster training and potentially improve generalization.
- Classifier Addition: Introduce an additional classifier to improve decision-making capabilities, enhancing the model's overall classification performance.

Working on Code Reproducibility:
- Dataset Management: Currently importing a 1.1 GB photo dataset to GitHub to ensure easy access and version control for future reference.
- Smooth Execution: Ensuring that the code runs smoothly for the teaching assistant who will execute it. This includes thorough documentation and streamlined dependencies to facilitate setup and usage.

Exploring New Model Options:
- Model Experimentation: Actively exploring new models to enhance performance and discover innovative approaches to problem-solving.
- Transfer Learning Consideration: Considering transfer learning due to its ability to leverage pre-trained models, which can significantly reduce training time and improve accuracy, especially when working with limited datasets. This approach allows for the application of learned features from large datasets to specific tasks, enhancing model robustness.
