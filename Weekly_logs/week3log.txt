Implementation of Early Stopping in the current PyTorch CNN model:
- Introduced early stopping based on validation loss to mitigate overfitting caused by high variance.
- This technique allows the model to terminate training when performance on the validation set starts to degrade, preventing excessive fitting to the training data.

Impact on Model Performance:
- The implementation of early stopping has significantly improved the model's performance on unseen data from the outside dataset.
- The model still maintains an impressive 97% overall performance accuracy while achieving 89% accuracy on the outside dataset.
- This demonstrates a successful balance between model generalization and retention of high accuracy across different datasets.
