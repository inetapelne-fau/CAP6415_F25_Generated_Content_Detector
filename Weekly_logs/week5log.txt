Implementation of Statistical Models

Textbook and Resource Review: 
- Examined our textbook and slides to understand the concepts and methodologies for implementing statistical models.

Statistical Feature Extraction: 
- Extracted various statistical features from the images, including:
  * Fourier Transforms: Analyzed frequency components.
  * Gradients: Captured edge information and changes in intensity.
  * Patch-Based Variance Statistics: Evaluated local image variations to identify textures.
  * Gaussian Blur Residual Statistics: Assessed residuals post-blurring to highlight significant features.

Application of Traditional ML Models: 
- Applied traditional machine learning models to the extracted statistical features.
- Evaluated model performance to identify the best methods for analyzing and interpreting image data.

README File Development: 
- Worked on the README file to document the project details, methodologies, and instructions for future users.

Video Presentation Creation: 
- Created a video presentation to showcase the statistical model implementation and findings.
