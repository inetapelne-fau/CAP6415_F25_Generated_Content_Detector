WEEK 1 LOG
Date: 11/09/2025 

Framework Selection:
- Investigated popular deep learning frameworks, comparing TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Chose PyTorch for its flexibility, ease of prototyping, and dynamic computation graph that simplifies debugging.

Project Scope & Focus:
- Defined the main goal: to develop a system that differentiates between real faces and AI-generated faces.
- Focused on facial imagery due to its relevance in synthetic media detection and widespread availability.
- Identified key challenges, including generalization across different generative models and robustness to image distortions such as compression, noise, and blurring.

Dataset Acquisition & Initial Handling:  
- Downloaded a relevant dataset from Kaggle containing real and AI-generated face images.
- Uploaded the dataset to Google Colab and unzipped the files for preliminary inspection.
- Began exploring the dataset to assess image quality, class balance, and potential biases.
- Planning to develop data loaders and preprocessing pipelines in the upcoming week.

Initial Literature & Dataset Research:
- Reviewed recent research papers and surveys on deepfake detection and AI-generated image classification.
- Examined features and models commonly used in state-of-the-art approaches, such as CNN-based classifiers, frequency domain features, and classical image features.
- Identified potential baseline methods for future comparison.

Next Steps for Week 2:   
- Implement a data loader to efficiently load, shuffle, and preprocess images during training.
- Develop and evaluate a simple baseline classifier, such as a CNN or a classical feature-based model.
- Visualize sample images and class distribution to validate dataset quality.
- Begin preliminary feature extraction and model training, aiming to establish a baseline accuracy.
