WEEK 1 LOG
Date: 11/09/2025 

Framework Selection:
- Researched popular deep learning frameworks, compared TensorFlow and PyTorch.
- Chose PyTorch for its flexibility, ease of prototyping, and dynamic computation graph that simplifies debugging.

Project Scope & Focus:
- Defined the main goal: to develop a system that differentiates between real faces and AI-generated faces.
- Chose facial images because they are highly relevant and widely used in synthetic media detection.
- Aimed to address challenges like model generalization across different generative models, and robustness against image distortions such as compression, noise, and blurring.

Dataset Acquisition & Initial Handling:  
- Downloaded a relevant dataset from Kaggle containing real and AI-generated face images.
- Uploaded the dataset to Google Colab and unzipped the files for preliminary inspection.
- Began exploring the dataset, reviewing the image quality, class distribution, and potential biases.
- Planned to create dataset loaders and preprocessing pipelines in the coming week.

Next Steps for Week 2:   
- Implement a data loader to efficiently load, shuffle, and preprocess images during training.
- Design and test a simple baseline classifier (e.g., CNN or classical feature-based model).
- Visualize the dataset to confirm class labels and evaluate data quality.
- Begin preliminary feature extraction and model training, aiming to establish a baseline accuracy.
