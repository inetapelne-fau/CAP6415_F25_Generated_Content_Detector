Implementation of EfficientNet, ResNet, and VisionTransformer for Enhanced Comparative Analysis in Face Content Detection:
- Model Overview: I implemented EfficientNet, ResNet, and VisionTransformer (ViT) to leverage their unique strengths in enhancing model performance.
- EfficientNet: This model was chosen for its high accuracy and efficiency, utilizing fewer parameters and lower computational resources. Its architecture is ideal for deployment in resource-constrained environments, enabling effective detection of face-generated content.
- ResNet: Selected for its powerful residual learning framework, ResNet facilitates the training of very deep networks. Its ability to mitigate issues like vanishing gradients makes it suitable for capturing complex patterns in face images, enhancing overall performance.
- VisionTransformer (ViT): I opted for ViT due to its innovative attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on important parts of the input images. This is particularly beneficial for distinguishing subtle differences in face content.
- Comparative Analysis: I ran all three models simultaneously, comparing their performance metrics to identify the most effective approach. The results have been documented in a GitHub repository for analysis.
- Transfer Learning: By leveraging pretrained weights across these models, I achieved quicker training times and improved accuracy, benefiting from features learned on diverse datasets.
