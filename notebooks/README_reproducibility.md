# ⚙️ Reproducibility Instructions
To ensure that this project can be easily reproduced, follow the instructions below. 

All models are designed to run smoothly using the provided code within the Python Jupyter notebooks located in this GitHub repository. Ensure that you have the required libraries and imports, which are specified at the beginning of each notebook.


## 🚀 Running the Models

- **Environment Setup:** I recommend using Google Colab for running the code. It provides free access to GPUs, which will significantly speed up the training process.
- **Required Libraries:** Google Colab comes pre-installed with the following libraries, eliminating the need for any additional installation steps. If you're using a different environment, please ensure that you have the following libraries installed:
   - PyTorch and TorchVision for deep learning models.
   - Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.
   - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation.
   - OpenCV for image processing.
   - Scikit-learn for additional machine learning models and metrics.
   - TQDM for progress bars.

You can install these libraries using pip:

## ⚠️ Special Instructions for Model A

When running **Model A**, you will be prompted to provide input for saving the model. Make sure to specify the desired file path and name when prompted, as this model requires user interaction for saving.

Here’s an example of how the input might look when saving Model A:
